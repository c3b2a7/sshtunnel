Usage of ./sshtunnel:
  -config string
    	config file
  -v	show version information
  -verbose

```

## Quick Start

At first, you need write a configuration like this:

```json
{
  "target": "host:port",
  "username": "username",
  "private-key": "location of ssh private key",
  "passphrase": "private-key passphrase or password of username",
  "tunnels": [
    {
      "local": "127.0.0.1:13306",
      "remote": "172.16.0.14:3306",
      "mode": "local"
    },
    {
      "local": "127.0.0.1:8080",
      "remote": "0.0.0.0:18080",
      "mode": "remote"
    },
    {
      "local": "127.0.0.1:1080",
      "mode": "dynamic"
    }
  ]
}
```

and then, use the following command to start ssh tunnel:

```shell
./sshtunnel -config /path/to/config -verbose
```

after the tunnel is established:

connect to the remote MySQL service like connecting to the localï¼š

```shell
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 13306 -u root -p # in local
```

connect to local service in remote:

```shell
nc -l 8080 # in local
nc localhost 18080 # in remote
```

connect to dynamic addr using socks5 protocol via remote server:

```shell
curl -x socks5://localhost:1080 ip.sb # in local
```
